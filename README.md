# IEEE_Fraud_Detection
CSE 519 Data Science Fundamentals project to detect fraudulent transactions. 


I took the course CSE 519 Data Science Fundamentals under Prof. Steven Skiena in Fall 2019 at Stony Brook University. As part of the course, we had to take the kaggle challenge of 'IEEE Fraud Detection.'


In this, we have a list of transactions, the goal is to classify them into Fraud/Non-Fruad transactions.

This repo has the following files:
1) Fraud_Detection.py - Contains the python code for the tasks assigned.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. I have used various sources to learn and work on this project. Please contact me for citation, if applicable. I would also like to thank Prof. Skiena for his guidance and wonderful lectures.
